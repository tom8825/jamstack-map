Inside Be Our Guest are three separate dining areas, themed after the ballroom, Rose Gallery, and West Wing from Disney's animated film <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThe restaurant is so far back inside the Magic Kingdom that there are no windows to the outside world in any of the three dining rooms, because the view from them would be of the park's otherwise hidden infrastructure. The lack of windows makes the dining rooms dark, especially the West Wing room. As in the movie, Beast's enchanted rose appears in the West Wing, not in the dining room named \"Rose Gallery.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBe Our Guest's 550 seats fill up fast, with a noise level to match. The lights are dimmed at dinner, which offers a fixed-price table service meal with a tad more serenity.\r\n</p>",

    "summary": "<p>\r\nDeclining food quality, high prices, and difficult-to-get reservations\r\nhave taken their toll on Be Our Guest, whose reader ratings have dropped\r\nsteeply in the past year. The comments of this reader from Raleigh, North\r\nCarolina, are particularly illustrative:\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThese changes, especially the fixed-price dinner, have led Be Our Guest its worst reader survey ratings in five years. Those survey results indicate Be Our Guest is a below-average restaurant when compared with others in Walt Disney World.\r\n</p>\r\n<blockquote>I was very disappointed by my most recent visit to Be Our Guest for lunch.\r\nThe croque monsieur used to be a staple for me. It’s a grilled ham-and-cheese sandwich, and they used to make it with carved ham and Gruyère. On this\r\ntrip, the it consisted of cold deli ham and a cheese (béchamel?) sauce rather\r\nthan actual melted cheese. A croque monsieur is, by definition, a GRILLED\r\nsandwich, and I don’t think it should be legal to promise a croque monsieur\r\nand deliver the cold monstrosity I was given.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nIf you're looking for better food at comparable prices, the <a href=\"https://touringplans.com/magic-kingdom/dining/liberty-tree-tavern\">Liberty Tree Tavern</a> and <a href=\"https://touringplans.com/magic-kingdom/dining/crystal-palace\">Crystal Palace</a> are better choices for lunch and dinner.</p>\r\n<p>\r\nFor cheaper dining, the <a href=\"https://touringplans.com/magic-kingdom/dining/main-street-bakery\">Main Street Bakery</a> is a better choice for a fast breakfast. <a href=\"https://touringplans.com/magic-kingdom/dining/columbia-harbour-house\">Columbia Harbour House</a> is the highest-rated restaurant in the Magic Kingdom, and makes a great stop for a quick lunch. Finally, the <a href=\"https://touringplans.com/magic-kingdom/dining/liberty-square-market/menus/all-day-menu\">Liberty Square Market</a> food stand has tasty, freshly-grilled hot dogs that are great for lunch.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Reservations</h4><br>\r\n<p>\r\nIf you still want to dine at Be Our Guest, you'll want to make reservations 180 days in advance for all meals. You'll need to use a credit card to guarantee your reservation, and there's a $10 per person no-show fee if you don't show up or cancel within 24 hours. (Note that this is the only quick-service meal at Walt Disney World that accepts reservations.)\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Breakfast and Lunch</h4></br>\r\n<p>\r\nFor the counter service breakfast and lunch, touch-screen, automated terminals are available for guests to customize their orders. To skip this step at lunch, guests with reservations may instead order their food up to 30 days in advance via the <a href=\"http://mydisneyexperience.com\">My Disney Experience app or website</a>. For special dietary requests and cash orders, cashiers are available.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nAfter placing your order, you’ll sit down, and your order will be delivered to you on real tableware — no paper and plastic around here. Guests who have eaten at <a href=\"/walt-disney-world/dining/wolfgang-puck-express-marketplace\">Wolfgang Puck Express</a> in Downtown Disney will understand the process here. You retrieve your own silverware and fill your own beverage cups.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Dinner</h4></br>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nPopularity does not wane come evening. If you can't get a dinner reservation, check in person when the park opens for any same-day cancellations, though you may need a certain party size to fill a vacant table. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nDinner is a fixed-price table service meal and requires a credit card guarantee. While not a character meal, <em>per se</em>, Beast visits the dining room and is available for photos.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nThere are no dessert choices at dinner - everyone gets the same selection of three items (typically a dark chocolate truffle; an edible, white chocolate \"cup\" holding cookies-and-cream mousse; and a raspberry macaroon.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Video Review</h3>\r\n<iframe width=\"454\" height=\"220\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yx69YGbxdLc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<h3>Lunch Review</h3>\r\n<iframe width=\"454\" height=\"220\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A8YeuZT0cCg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n<h3>Dinner Review</h3>\r\n<iframe width=\"454\" height=\"220\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YXQBQiEi3Fk\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>",

Safe choices for picky eaters include the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and grilled root vegetables; or the roasted pork tenderloin with asparagus, brussel sprouts and sprinkled with bacon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe big surprise at dinner is that you can order wine and beer with your meal, because Be Our Guest is the first Magic Kingdom restaurant to serve alcohol. The wines are from France and California, and can be ordered by the glass or bottle. If you're feeling festive, champagne is available too (by the bottle only). Beers are from Belgium and France.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nFor kids at dinner, it’s grilled steak, grilled fish of the day, whole-grain macaroni, or grilled chicken breast.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nRelated articles:\r\n<a href=\"http://blog.touringplans.com/2014/02/15/saturday-six-six-reasons-love-guest-restaurant/\">SATURDAY SIX: Six Reasons We Love Be Our Guest</a>\r\n</p>",
